# tim-messanger

A small distributed, server-side TUI messenger accessible over SSH. This project is an educational/experimental set of C++20 microservices that communicate via MQTT and provide a minimal TUI frontend.

## Project spirit

Simplicity, reliability, and practical learning. The repository is a playground for experimenting with modern C++ features, Conan + CMake, Docker, and distributed architectures.

## Who is this for

This is a pet project. It's intended for developers and enthusiasts who want to learn about C++ microservices, experiment with MQTT and SSH-accessible TUIs, or use the architecture as a reference for their own experiments.

## How to contribute

-   Fork the repository and create a branch for your work: `feature/<short-description>`.
-   Follow the project's conventions: C++20, Pimpl for public interfaces, Conan + CMake for builds.
-   Open a pull request with a clear description and reproduction steps.
-   Small, focused changes are reviewed faster. For larger architectural changes, open an issue to discuss before implementing.

## Status

The project is under active development and currently has no releases.
